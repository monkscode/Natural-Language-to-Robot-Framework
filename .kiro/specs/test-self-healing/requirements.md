# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Test Self-Healing feature enhances the existing Mark 1 Natural Language to Robot Framework system by automatically detecting and correcting locator failures during test execution. When a test fails due to element locator issues, the system will intelligently analyze the failure, generate alternative locators, and validate them against the live application to create working test code.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a test automation engineer, I want the system to automatically detect when my tests fail due to locator issues, so that I don't have to manually debug and fix broken element selectors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Robot Framework test execution fails THEN the system SHALL analyze the failure logs to determine if the failure is locator-related
2. WHEN a locator-related failure is detected THEN the system SHALL extract the failing locator and target URL from the execution context
3. IF the failure reason contains "element not found" or similar locator errors THEN the system SHALL classify it as a self-healing candidate
4. WHEN multiple locator failures occur in a single test THEN the system SHALL process each failure independently

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a test automation engineer, I want the system to automatically generate alternative locators for failed elements, so that my tests can continue working even when the UI changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a failing locator is identified THEN the system SHALL launch a headless Chrome session to the target URL
2. WHEN the Chrome session is active THEN the system SHALL use AI agents to generate multiple alternative locator strategies
3. WHEN generating alternative locators THEN the system SHALL follow the existing priority order (ID, Name, CSS, XPath, Link Text)
4. WHEN creating new locators THEN the system SHALL generate at least 3 alternative locator candidates per failed element
5. IF the original locator was CSS-based THEN the system SHALL try XPath alternatives and vice versa

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a test automation engineer, I want the system to validate new locators against the live application, so that only working locators are used in the corrected test code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN alternative locators are generated THEN the system SHALL test each locator against the live Chrome session
2. WHEN testing a locator THEN the system SHALL verify the element exists and is interactable
3. WHEN a locator successfully finds an element THEN the system SHALL verify it matches the expected element type and properties
4. IF multiple locators are valid THEN the system SHALL select the most stable one based on the priority hierarchy
5. WHEN no alternative locators work THEN the system SHALL report the self-healing attempt as failed

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a test automation engineer, I want the system to automatically update my test code with working locators, so that my tests can be re-executed successfully without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a valid replacement locator is found THEN the system SHALL update the original Robot Framework test file
2. WHEN updating the test file THEN the system SHALL preserve all other test logic and only modify the failing locator
3. WHEN the test is updated THEN the system SHALL create a backup of the original test file with timestamp
4. WHEN multiple locators in the same test need healing THEN the system SHALL update all of them in a single operation
5. IF the test update is successful THEN the system SHALL automatically re-execute the test to verify the fix

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a test automation engineer, I want to receive detailed reports about self-healing activities, so that I can understand what changes were made and monitor the system's effectiveness.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN self-healing is triggered THEN the system SHALL log the original failure reason and failing locator
2. WHEN alternative locators are tested THEN the system SHALL log each attempt and its result
3. WHEN a successful healing occurs THEN the system SHALL log the old and new locators with reasoning
4. WHEN self-healing fails THEN the system SHALL log the failure reason and all attempted alternatives
5. WHEN the process completes THEN the system SHALL generate a self-healing report accessible via the web interface

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a test automation engineer, I want to configure self-healing behavior and set limits, so that I can control when and how the system attempts to fix my tests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the system THEN the user SHALL be able to enable or disable self-healing globally
2. WHEN self-healing is enabled THEN the user SHALL be able to set maximum retry attempts per locator
3. WHEN configuring healing THEN the user SHALL be able to specify timeout limits for Chrome session operations
4. IF self-healing fails multiple times for the same locator THEN the system SHALL temporarily disable healing for that specific element
5. WHEN healing is disabled for an element THEN the system SHALL still log the failure but not attempt automatic fixes
