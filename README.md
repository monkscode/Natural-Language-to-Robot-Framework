## 📝 Best Practices & Limitations

### Writing Effective Test Descriptions

**✅ Good Example:**
```
"Open Flipkart and search for shoes and then get the first product name"
```

**❌ Avoid:**
```
"Test the search"  (too vague)
"Check if everything works"  (not specific)
"Search for products"  (missing details)
```

**Pro Tips:**
1. **Be Specific**: Mention exact elements ("first product", "login button in header")
2. **One Goal Per Test**: Don't try to test everything in one query
3. **Use Full URLs**: "amazon.com" is better than "Amazon"
4. **Mention Actions Explicitly**: "click", "enter", "verify", "get text"

### Current Limitations

**What Mark 1 Does Well:**
- ✅ Web UI testing (search, navigation, data extraction)
- ✅ E-commerce workflows
- ✅ Form filling and submission
- ✅ Element validation and assertions
- ✅ Multi-step workflows

**What Mark 1 Doesn't Support (Yet):**
- ❌ File uploads/downloads
- ❌ Complex authentication (OAuth, 2FA)
- ❌ Mobile app testing
- ❌ API testing
- ❌ Database validation
- ❌ Email verification
- ❌ Parallel test execution

### Performance Considerations

- **Test Generation Time**: 15-30 seconds (depends on complexity)
- **Test Execution Time**: Varies by website (typically 10-60 seconds)
- **API Rate Limits**: Gemini free tier = 1,500 requests/day
- **Concurrent Tests**: One at a time (parallel execution coming soon)

### Security & Privacy

- **API Keys**: Stored locally in `.env` file (never committed to git)
- **Test Data**: All processing happens locally or in your chosen cloud
- **Browser Sessions**: Isolated in Docker containers
- **Logs**: Stored locally in `logs/` directory

**Using Sensitive Data?** Consider using Ollama with local models for complete privacy.
